# cocos2dx-imgui

This is my attempt at fixing old and outdated ImGui binding for Cocos2d-x engine.
I've replaced OpenGL2 renderer backend with OpenGL3.

So far it seems to be working nicely.

This repository includes complete project demo. 
Feel free to use, modify or distribute it any way you want.
